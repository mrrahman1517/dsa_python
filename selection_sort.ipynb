    "# Selection Sort Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates two approaches to implementing the selection sort algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Version 1**: Creates a new sorted list (modifies original as side effect)\n",
    "2. **Version 2**: True in-place selection sort algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Error Fix:\n",
    "The original implementation had a bug in the while loop condition:\n",
    "- **Problem**: `while len(original_result) >= 0` continues even when list is empty\n",
    "- **Fix**: `while len(original_result) > 0` stops when list is empty\n",
    "- **Root Cause**: `min()` on empty list raises `ValueError`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview:\n",
    "Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element and placing it in the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity**: O(n²) in all cases  \n",
    "**Space Complexity**: O(1) for in-place, O(n) for copy version"
